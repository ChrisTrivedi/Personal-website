# Chris Trivedi website
This is my Personal Website based on George Cushen's [Hugo Academic theme](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic), and hosted through Netlify.

I feel I should also give credit to a few other websites that really inspired the design here. Namely:

[Luke Holman](https://www.lukeholman.org/) and [Leslie Myint](https://lmyint.github.io/)
