# abstract: Biological sulfur cycling in polar, low-temperature ecosystems is an understudied phenomenon in part due to difficulty of access and the ephemeral nature of such environments. One such environment where sulfur cycling plays an important role in microbial metabolisms is located at Borup Fiord Pass (BFP) in the Canadian High Arctic. Here, transient springs emerge from the toe of a glacier creating a large proglacial aufeis (spring-derived ices) that are often covered in bright yellow/white sulfur, sulfate, and carbonate mineral precipitates that are accompanied by a strong odor of hydrogen sulfide. Metagenomic sequencing from multiple sample types at sites across the BFP glacial system produced 31 highly complete metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) that were queried for sulfur-, nitrogen- and carbon-cycling/metabolism genes. Sulfur cycling, especially within the Sox complex of enzymes, was widespread across the isolated MAGs and taxonomically associated with the bacterial classes Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Epsilon- Proteobacteria. While this does agree with previous research from BFP implicating organisms within the Gamma- and Epsilon- Proteobacteria as the primary classes responsible for sulfur oxidation, our new data suggests putative sulfur oxidation by organisms within Alpha- and Beta- Proteobacterial classes which was not predicted. These findings indicate that in a low-temperature, ephemeral sulfur-based environment such as this, functional redundancy may be a key mechanism that microorganisms use to co-exist whenever energy is limited and/or focused by redox chemistry.
